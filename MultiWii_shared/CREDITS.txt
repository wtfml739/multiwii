   This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
   contributed to the MultiWii project.  It is unsorted and incomplete.  
   Policy is to leave marks here and not scattered all over the code.
   In the best of all worlds a name mentioned here was synonymous for 
   the person taking the responsibility of support and maintaining the code. 
   The initial version of this file was created by moving the info 
   from comments in the code.
   If you do not find your name here, it is not meant as a disrespect
   of your work. Please, feel free to add your name here.

 Thanks,

         Hamburger
