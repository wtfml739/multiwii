
WMC with ProMicro support

till now:

- Output seem to work
- Sensors seem to work
- USB communication with GUI partially works (Write PID and AUX settings dosent work)
- RX input works

NOTE
dont mess with serial or USB registers if you dont have possibility to reflash the bootloader!
if you do something wrong with it you cant upload skatches with the USB anymore (I had to reflash it a serval times -.-)
